1. Reflect on the following questions in the survey you’ll submit:
- How do you feel about the expectations of the professional development curriculum?

+ This is the aspect of the program that I am most concerned with I think. I have never really cared much for doing this kind of work. I have largely just done as I wish and I have floated around to various jobs. I have never been that interested in work or careers up to this point though. I think that the expectations are reasonable but I know that this part will be much more difficult for me than the technical aspects. I am a good communicator but not very organised and I really don't like to sell myself in the interview and application phase.

- What are you excited about when it comes to professional development?

+ I would be lying if I said that there was anything that I was really excited about. I am looking forward to experiencing it a bit and trying to understand if I can reach a good place with these sorts of things, but I would not say that it is exciting. I have tried things like calendaring in the past to no avail. I have also failed at interviewing on several occasions. I think it would be good to improve these skills a bit. It is exciting to think about overcoming some of my concerns and hesitations in this area and I sincerely hope I will be able to. I have generally felt pretty hopeless in this area.

- What are your questions or concerns about these expectations?

+ I have always felt really bad about my interviewing ability and the concept of trying to sell myself to potential employers. It just has never sat well with me to sort of brag and talk about what makes me so great. I think I have gotten better about it as I have aged a bit, but right out of undergrad I was really uninterested in performing for interviews. I don't really have any questions about this right now but I am sure that they will come up as we descend into the meat of the course.

- Please rate on a scale of 1-4 how easy the networking activity was for you.

1

- As you start at Turing, what are your biggest questions or concerns about networking?

+ This is something that I have never taken very seriously and I have never really tried to network. I have made connections with people and sometimes gained employment because of who I knew but I have generally tried to avoid that situation. I would just say that my biggest concern is that it is something totally knew to me. I have never put any considerable effort into this front. The unknown is my concern.  
----
- Tell us about yourself. What is your background? Why are you pursuing a career in software development?

+ My background is mostly in academia. I studied English and Economics and then did a masters in English. I originally wanted to pursue a phd in english but I decided that this would be a bad idea. Since completing my degree I have worked at our family business because my dad was in a tough spot and I worked at the university where I completed my masters as a professor of composition. In the last year I have become increasingly interested in open-source soft-ware and I really believe in the mission to make software free and accessible to all. I have been on quite a journey through linux and I want to be able to contribute to other open-source projects. I am generally very good with technical work and I really enjoy doing it. As a kid I was trained to be a bicycle mechanic and I feel like the laws of mechanical logic are not all too dissimilar to computer-based logic. It is something that feels very natural to me. I have never been very concerned about a career or making money, but I would like to contribute to something bigger than me and I feel like software will be a way to do that.

- What are your goals for this career?

+ I am hoping to develop apps that put utility first and provide services to people that need them. I think there are still a lot of holes in the software world that need to be filled by free and readily available solutions. There are applications that either need to be built from the ground up or just need to be maintained by people that really care about their purpose and function. I want to contribute to applications and foundations that push non-proprietary solutions to real issues and help put an end to people needing to pay or subscribe to services and surrender their information to marketing firms in order to complete their daily tasks. I find that practice to be very un-fair and I would like to help raise awareness of alternatives.

- As you start at Turing, what are your biggest questions or concerns about interviewing?

+ I think when I interview I tend to be a bit too honest. I have a lot of trouble with telling people what they would like to hear and trying to convince them that I am the right person for the job. I am hoping that through Turing I am able to learn some interviewing approaches that work for me and don't make me feel like I am misleading employers. 
----
- Do you have a LinkedIn profile? If so, how do you currently use it? How frequently do you use it?

+ I have one but I have not logged into it in maybe 2 years. I have not been very actively seeking employment. I have considered phd programs mostly and just worked odd jobs. I have not been very career oriented. For all intents and purposes I don't have a linkedin but if you type my name in you will find something.

- Have you created a resume before? If so, how confident have you felt about your resume’s effectiveness previously? What questions or concerns do you have about writing a technical resume?

+ I would imagine that my resume was not very effective. I have made a couple for various things and most people who have reviewed them have not been very favorable. I don't really understand what employers want to know about me or how to let them know I am the right person for the job.

+ How to phrase sentences and how to discuss what kinds of skills you can bring to the table. I have also always been very confused about how to format these and what the most important things are.

- Have you written a cover letter for a job posting before? If so, how confident have you felt about your cover letters’ effectiveness previously? What questions or concerns do you have about writing cover letters?

+ I do think that I do well with cover letters. I am a writer first and have spent a lot of time working on that skill. I think my voice is sometimes too frank and not very professional when I write cover letters, but I have never really had to write a cover letter for anything very important. I think if I have some clear guidelines this is something that I can do very well.

----
- Describe your approach to job searching in the past. What steps were part of your strategy? What was effective for you? What wasn’t effective for you?

+ I haven't really ever done a job search. I have mostly been in school, working for my father, or working jobs where I was offered a position before I applied. I have never had to devise a strategy or sift out good approaches from bad. When I have applied for jobs they have been jobs that I was not very interested in and I didn't put very much energy into the application process. I would say that is not a very effective strategy.

- When you think about job searching for a software developer position, what are your biggest questions or concerns?

+ I have mentioned this at length now so I won't belabour the point, but I have just never been in this arena so the whole thing is a big question and a big concern. I am sure that as we proceed I will find many specific questions to ask, but at this point I am really just waiting to get into it.
----
- Have you negotiated for a salary before? If so, what were the results? How did you feel about the experience?
- When you think about negotiating for a software development position, what are your biggest questions or concerns?

+ I have never made more than $15,000 a year from part time work so I am very used to being underpaid and not worrying about it very much. I think it will be really hard for me to ask for an appropriate wage and negotiate at all because even $30,000 seems like an extreme amount of money to me right now. I know that the salaries that are quoted coming out of this program are really high and that scares me a bit. I don't know how to establish what I think I am worth to a company.
